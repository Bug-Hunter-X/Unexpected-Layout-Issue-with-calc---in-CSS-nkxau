The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, causing unexpected layout issues. Specifically, the calculation `calc(100% - 10px)` within the `width` property of a container element does not subtract 10 pixels from the full width as intended. Instead, the container's width still occupies 100% of its parent.
